# Problem Set 2

## Overview

This was an assignment for SIS 750 - Data Analysis for Dr Austin Hart in Spring 2024 at American University in Washington DC.

Purpose of this problem set was to continue to gain familiarity with r code, correcting it, creating basic visualisations, reacquaint ourselves with communicating key information. For this problem set we were tasked with completing eight questions

- Question 1
  - Provide the link to github profile

- Question 2
  - Annotate and correct a provided code chunk, noting what each section of code did that was special

- Question 3
  - Provide the unit of observation for the data that we were working with

- Question 4
  - Provide a table and brief description of what the data presented meant as well as a summary of key averages

- Question 5
  - Report the number of cases that meet following criteria: 
    - In 2015, scored high or above for greenspace
    - Scored exceptionally low for any time frame
    - Using weighted annual average, arid climate greenspaces that became greener from 2010 to 2015
    
- Question 6
  - Using the annual average, how many areas became less green between 2010 to 2021? Were the decreases concentrated in a particular region or climate?

- Question 7
  - Using the annual average from 2010 to 2021, create a histogram that demonstrates a change in greenspace

- Question 8
  - Create a scatter plot using weighted population in 2021 over greenspace in 2010
